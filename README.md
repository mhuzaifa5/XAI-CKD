# XAI-CKD
Explainable AI for Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction via Fine-Tuned LLMs
# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction  
*A Benchmark Against ML and Deep Learning Models*  

---

## 📌 Project Summary  
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health challenge and a "silent killer," often progressing without early symptoms.  
This research explores the use of **fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)** for early CKD prediction, benchmarking their performance against traditional **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models.  

Unlike black-box ML/DL approaches, LLMs can provide **natural language explanations**, bridging the gap between AI predictions and **clinician trust**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Fine-tune LLMs on CKD patient data and compare results with ML/DL baselines (SVM, Random Forest, ANN, CNN, etc.).  
- **Explainability:** Implement self-explanation prompting so the LLM generates **transparent reasoning** behind predictions.  
- **Deployment:** Build a **web + mobile app** CKD risk prediction system for healthcare professionals and patients at **Pakistan Kidney Center (PKC), Abbottabad**.

## 🧪 Methodology  

1. **Data Collection:** Demographics, lab results, and clinical measurements from PKC.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and balancing (SMOTE/augmentation if needed).  
3. **Serialization:** Convert tabular data → natural language descriptions or structured formats (JSON/YAML).  
4. **Training:** Fine-tune LLMs with PEFT techniques (LoRA/QLoRA) for efficiency.  
5. **Evaluation:** Benchmark LLMs against ML/DL models using **Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, AUC**.  
6. **Explainability:** Self-explanation prompting → LLM outputs medical reasoning in natural language.  
7. **Deployment:** Best model integrated into **clinical workflow + app interface**.
